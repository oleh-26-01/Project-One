Third part ui design

Side Panel:
	1. Show only list of selected tracks;
	2. Next to track name show amout of checkpoints;
	3. There will be two buttons: "Select" and "Watch";
	4. "Select" button will select track, and load genome and etc. or create new genome;
	5. "Watch" button will "play" genome. 
		This button have two states: Red color - unavailable and Green color - available;

Top Panel:
	1. [Train | Stop] button;
	2. "Multi-threading" checkbox;
	3. "Hide replay" checkbox;
	4. "Generation №", "Best score" and "best to average rate" labels;
	5. "Reset" button;

Genome:
	1. Contain car entity;
	2. Know about track;
	3. Have "genome" - list of genes;
		List of genes - sequence of car actions;
	4. Have "fitness" - score of genome;
		Fitness is based on distance to next checkpoint and time of driving;
	5. Tickrate must be defined;

Population-agent:
	1. Contain list of genomes;
	2. Know about track;
	3. Generate start population;
	4. Analize genomes, and select best;
	5. Create new generation of genomes;
	6. Save best genome and every N generation;
	
	* Implement a gene significance system:
	1. Each gene have a significance;
	2. Gene with high significance hava less chance to be mutated;
	3. Gene with higher significance have more chance to be inherited;
